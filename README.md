# Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions
This repository consists of the finished labs and assignments from [Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/custom-models-layers-loss-functions-with-tensorflow) course. It is the first course in [TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques). Due to transaction issues, I could not acquire the official certification. The learned materials throughout the course are as follows,

 1. Functional APIs
 2. Custom Loss Functions
 3. Custom Layers
 4. Custom Models
 5. Custom Callbacks
